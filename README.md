Changelog

The library isn't versioned in a coherent way; there are no version numbers you
can refer to. There are, however, a bunch of dates when I made some changes:

**1.0.0 - 15/12/2013**

* Selected menu item can be remembered (thanks to KipK)
* Examples for serial and LCDs (thanks to niesteszeck)
* Add AUTHORS file

**0.3.0 - 23/03/2013**

* Merged in another minor improvement provided by thomasjfox:
 * Add the ability to loop through a menu in prev() and next()

**0.2.0 - 18/03/2013**

* Merged in minor improvements provided by thomasjfox
 * get_menu_component(): Use 'byte' instead of 16bit integer for index
 * Add return value to MenuSystem.back()
 * Prevent memory corruption by inserting too many items
 * Whitespace cleanup

**0.1.0 - 25/05/2012**

* Added support for displaying all current menu items (thanks to arcachofo)
* Added this readme

Note: The changes made for this release break backwards compatability. The
issues are relatively easy to fix.
